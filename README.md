# Assignment 3: Clustering and Fitting

This repository contains the code and findings for the third assignment of the "Applied Data Science 1" course (7PAM2000).

## Overview

The assignment explores public data from the World Bank, specifically focusing on country-by-country indicators related to climate change. Clustering methods and curve fitting techniques are applied to uncover meaningful patterns and trends within the dataset.

## Key Findings

- Identified clusters of countries based on climate change variables.
- Utilized KMeans clustering and curve fitting to extract insights.
- Visualized trends through scatter plots, line plots, and comparative analysis between clusters.

## File Structure

- `main_code.py`: Python code containing clustering, fitting, and visualization.
- `ScatterPlot.png`, `LinePlot.png`, `Plot.png`, `BoxPlot.png`, `CurveFitting.png`: Resulting plots.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the assignment.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Review the code in `main_code.py` for implementation details.
3. Explore the generated plots for visual insights.
